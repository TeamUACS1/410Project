# 410Project
Group project for CMPUT 410. Social Media is a social networking website that allows uses to make and share various posts with other users on the website.  
  
[Check out the project requirements here](https://github.com/abramhindle/CMPUT404-project-socialdistribution/blob/master/project.org)  

Installation and running the Server
========================
Activate your virtual environment and make sure you have Django installed (you can install Django with $pip install django)

To run the server, go into the base directory (default is /socialmedia/ folder) run "./manage.py runserver". Make sure that manage.py has executable permissions (chmod +x manage.py)

Testing
========================
To run tests, run the script "./run_test_script". Again make sure this file has permissions (chmod +x run_test_script). The tests script expects that the server is running while you run the tests and that their is access to the Github website. The tests will still run if without these requirements but there will be some tests that fail/error.
